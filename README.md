# Tracer

Generate SVG paths that perfectly match the contours of an element, even when the children protrude or lie completely outside the parent.

Effects are controllable through CSS or JS.

To use `yarn link` efficiently, do this:

```bash
> cd corner-radius
> yarn link
> yarn build --watch
> cd ../my-other-library
> yarn link corner-radius
```
